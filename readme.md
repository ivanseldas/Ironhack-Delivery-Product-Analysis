## 1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

**Objective:** Identify the top three KPIs for IronHack Delivery.

- **KPIs Selected:**
  1. **Customer Retention Rate**
  2. **Average Delivery Time**

## 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Objective:** Analyze discrepancies between checkout prices and actual prices for non-integrated partners.

- **Insights:**
  - Calculated under-authorization rate.
  - Evaluated 20% authorization increase effectiveness.
  - Country-wise comparison.
  - Identified high-risk stores.
  - Analyzed cancellation correlation with price differences.
